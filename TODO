# * In the above load() block, it would be nice to be able to nest
#   blocks.  For example:
#
# Text.load("somefile.odt") do
#   
#   change_mode ... 
#   
#   add_para(...) |para|
#       para.this
#       para.that
#   end
#    
#   # note that here we have the implicit context provided by
#   instance_eval and a local block variable |para|
#
#   table = Table do
#       name "mytable" # not sure whether this is possible with instance_eval
#   end
#
# end
#
# * Better error checking / debugging
